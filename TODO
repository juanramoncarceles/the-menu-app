BUGS:
  ☐ Cart items categories should appear in a fixed order according to the menu page.
    They could be ordered in the createOrderTableJSX() method of the Cart component.
  ☐ Save 'settings' in AppContext also from the 'menu' page.
    Implementation would be similar to the 'catalog' page.
  ☐ If I access the 'catalog' page first then I have no data about categories in AppContext, so in the cart doesn't appear any category information.
    Maybe the data from categories should be added to AppContext one by one according to the 'category' pages that are visited?
    Thay way the required category data would be always avaialble when opening the cart. Since only the 'id' and 'name' are necessary it would work.
  ☐ Currently if 'settings' change they are not updated because in the catalog's 'useEffect' there is no 'settings' dependency.
    Watch them or separate in two different dispatch actions to control them better in context reducer? An action like 'StoreSettings'.
  ☐ Remove the focus outline of Chrome on buttons.
  ☐ Import SVGs as React components with babel-plugin-inline-react-svg

  ☐ Add margin bottom on the items container to avoid last items to remain behaind the cart component at the bottom of the viewport.

CHANGES:
  ☐ Rename action "Store" to "StoreItems" in reducer.
  ☐ Make the food item svg image placeholder be inline? @low 

FEATURES:
  ☐ Create a mock for the fetched data from the back-end API to avoid calling it during front-end development.
  ☐ Store order data in localStorage as well so it is persistent.
    Maybe this is not a good idea if a new client comes? A reset button could be useful in any case.
  ☐ Change quantities of items also from the cart component itself. Specifically form the column with the quantities.
    Similar to the WooCommerce cart.

DONE:
  ✔ Cart total items should be the total amount of items, not the total types of items. @low @done(20-10-02 21:44)
  ✔ Only if item amount is bigger than 0 show the border. @done(20-09-24 23:23)
  ✔ Item amount cannot be less than 0. @done(20-09-24 23:16)
  ✔ In the catalog.tsx set a default path to a placeholder image in case an item image is missing. @done(20-09-27 17:35)
    The image should be stored in the public folder and referenced from there.
