BUGS:
  ☐ Cart total items should be the total amount of items, not the total types of items. @low
  ☐ In the catalog.tsx set a default path to a placeholder image in case an item image is missing.
    The image should be stored in the public folder and referenced from there.
  ☐ Remove the focus outline of Chrome on buttons.
  ☐ Import SVGs as React components with babel-plugin-inline-react-svg
