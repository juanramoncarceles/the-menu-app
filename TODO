DONE:
  ✔ Only if item amount is bigger than 0 show the border. @done(20-09-24 23:23)
  ✔ Item amount cannot be less than 0. @done(20-09-24 23:16)
  ✔ In the catalog.tsx set a default path to a placeholder image in case an item image is missing. @done(20-09-27 17:35)
    The image should be stored in the public folder and referenced from there.
